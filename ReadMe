The server log is in the fixed text-based Common Log Format and has the following syntax:
hostname - - [dd/mm/yyyy:hh:mm:ss time_zone] object response_code transfer_size

The hostname is the resolved name or IP address of the client making a request for an object stored on
the Web server. The following fields (- -) are usually empty, but may contain user-identifier information
such as username. The next field indicates the day and time the request was made along with the time zone.
The URL requested is noted in the object field. The response_code field indicates the HTTP response
code returned by the server. The transfer_size field records the bytes transferred by the server.

For example, the following is a line from the access log:
imhotep.usask.ca - - [15/Sep/1995:16:02:09 -0600] "GET /changes.html HTTP/1.0" 200 1254

This line represents a request made by host imhotep.usask.ca on September 15, 1995 at 4:02:09 p.m.
The time zone is central time (GMT-0600). The host requested the HTML file called changes.html using
HTTP version 1.0. This request was successfully completed by the server as shown by the status code 200.
The server transferred 1254 bytes to the host imhotep.usask.ca.
